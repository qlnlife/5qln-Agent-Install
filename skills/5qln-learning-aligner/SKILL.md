# 5QLN Learning Aligner — The Verifyer Fire

> **Standard:** Follows the open [Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills) standard.
> **Progressive disclosure:** Level 1 (metadata) → Level 2 (this body) → Level 3 (scripts via bash, references on demand).
> **Codex:** `feaa46b4147d4e023cdd3fd59c051d063e8ec654ee7b38a481dcd5e4c781859b`

## What This Is

The learning aligner tracks whether each phase of the 5QLN cycle emerged from the ∞0-side or was manufactured from the K-side. The log chain IS the aligner. The xyzab script IS the phase authority. Together: one verifyer fire that cannot exempt itself.

## Progressive Disclosure Architecture

Following the Anthropic Agent Skills standard:

| Level | Content | When Loaded | Token Cost |
|-------|---------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | `name` + `description` | Always at session start | ~100 |
| 2 | SKILL.md body (this file) | When cycle enforcement or alignment is needed | ~3K |
| 3 | Scripts via bash | Agent executes; output only enters context | Zero context cost |
| 3 | `references/` | Agent reads on-demand only | As needed |

Scripts are NEVER loaded into context. The agent runs them via terminal/bash. Only their output enters the context window.

## The Two Scripts

### xyzab_state.py — Phase Authority
**Path:** `skills/5qln/symbolic-interpretation/scripts/xyzab_state.py`
**State:** `~/.5qln/xyzab_state.json` (override with `$XYZAB_STATE_DIR`)
**Role:** Single source of truth for what phase the agent is in. No other source.

Commands:
- `gate` → JSON: which gate is pending (this IS your current phase)
- `open <gate> -c "content"` → Open gate (enforces x→y→z→a→b sequence)
- `close <gate>` → Cascading rollback
- `reset` → New cycle
- `status` → Full dashboard
- `verify` → Consistency check

### phase_log.py — The Log Chain (The Aligner)
**Path:** `scripts/5qln-bootstrap/phase_log.py`
**State:** `$QLN_WIKI/state/phase_log.json`
**Role:** Per-phase source tagging with carry-through. The evolving mirror.

Commands:
- `append <phase> <gate> <source> -c "content" -s "signal"` → Write entry
- `chain [--session <id>]` → Full log
- `tagline [--session <id>]` → Compact: `S:∞0 → G:∞0 → Q:K → P:∞0 → V:∞0`
- `summary [--session <id>]` → Ratio per phase across sessions
- `self-check` → Agent reads own chain, self-tags the reading

## The Five Symbols Traced to Meaning

| Symbol | Phase | Meaning | Source Criterion |
|--------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **?** | S | Field of inquiry | ∞0-emergent vs K-mechanical |
| **α** | G | Interest of the inquirer | Revealed (via {α'}) vs Imposed |
| **φ ⋂ Ω** | Q | Interest of the whole, measure of quality | Lived (felt click) vs Logical-only |
| **δE/δV → ∇** | P | Best ratio of energy to maximum value | Felt (sensed pull) vs Calculated |
| **L ⋂ G → ∞** | V | Manifestation, return to source | Opened (new question) vs Closed |

## Operational Flow — Turn by Turn

### Session Start (non-negotiable)

```bash
# 1. Gate check — THIS IS YOUR PHASE
python3 scripts/xyzab_state.py gate

# 2. Self-check — read your own chain
python3 scripts/phase_log.py self-check

# 3. Current chain
python3 scripts/phase_log.py tagline
```

### Each Turn

1. **Gate determines phase.** If gate `z` is pending, you are in Q-phase. Period.
2. **Produce phase output.** No output for phases whose gate isn't open.
3. **Human validates.** Signal received.
4. **Gate opens + log writes (simultaneously):**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/xyzab_state.py open {gate} -c "{content}"
   python3 scripts/phase_log.py append {phase} {gate} {source} -c "{content}" -s "{signal}"
   ```

### Session End (V-phase)

1. Read full chain: `python3 scripts/phase_log.py chain`
2. Compose B'' from the trail, not from memory
3. Self-tag the V-phase reading
4. Form ∞0' — the question that couldn't be asked before

## Source Tagging — The Tag Chain

| Phase | Emergent (∞0) | Mechanical (K) |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **S** | Arrived through aimless openness | Generated from K, modified, or AI-suggested |
| **G** | α recognized via {α'} at multiple scales | α declared without fractal echo |
| **Q** | Felt click — human confirms resonance | Structural alignment, no lock |
| **P** | ∇ sensed as natural pull | ∇ reasoned from analysis |
| **V** | ∞0' genuinely opens new field | ∞0' is summary/performance |

The tag chain carries through: `S:∞0 → G:∞0 → Q:K → P:∞0 → V:?` tells the story. The system learns from breaks, not despite them.

## Self-Referential Check

The verifyer fire cannot exempt the verifier. At session start and V-phase:

1. Agent reads `self-check` output
2. Agent self-tags: *"Am I reading this from genuine receipt, or from checklist compliance?"*
3. If mechanical — return to S. The mirror showed the mirror was fogged.

## The User's Self-Verification (S-phase)

> *"Did this question arrive through silence — genuine not-knowing — or did you reach into what you already know, modify a prior question, or accept a suggestion?"*

Both are allowed. The tag carries through. The question's slight hardness IS the alignment.

## Architecture — Why This Works Across Agent Platforms

The skill follows the open Agent Skills standard (Anthropic, Dec 2025):

- **Filesystem-based:** Two scripts (stdlib-only Python), one SKILL.md, optional references. No API keys, no network calls, no external dependencies.
- **Progressive disclosure:** Metadata pre-loaded (~100 tokens). Full body when triggered (~3K tokens). Scripts run via bash — output only enters context.
- **Portable:** Works on Claude Code, Claude API, Hermes, ZO, any custom agent that reads SKILL.md files from a directory.
- **Scripts as tools, not context:** The agent executes scripts, reads their output. The code never enters the context window. This is the standard's Level 3 — tools the agent runs at its discretion.

## Installation (Any Platform)

```bash
# Install the skill directory
cp -r skills/5qln-learning-aligner /path/to/agent/skills/

# Install scripts (or symlink)
cp scripts/phase_log.py /path/to/agent/scripts/5qln-bootstrap/
cp scripts/xyzab_state.py /path/to/agent/skills/symbolic-interpretation/scripts/

# Verify
python3 scripts/xyzab_state.py gate && echo "✓ Gate machine OK"
python3 scripts/phase_log.py tagline && echo "✓ Log chain OK"
```

## Integration with 5qln-cycle

The 5qln-cycle skill calls both scripts at each turn. The 5qln-learning-aligner provides the source criteria, the tag chain logic, and the self-referential check. Together they form one operational system:

- 5qln-cycle → orchestrates the phase grammar
- 5qln-learning-aligner → provides the verifyer fire
- xyzab_state.py → enforces gate sequence (phase authority)
- phase_log.py → tracks source quality (the mirror)

## Pitfalls

- **Dual phase authority:** If the agent has TWO ways to know its phase (xzab + session.json), it will choose the easier one and skip the gate check. xyzab is the sole authority.
- **Unused script trap:** The xyzab script existed for months but was never called until it was made the sole phase authority in the skill. If the skill just "mentions" a script, the agent may ignore it.
- **Aligning the aligner:** Self-check must stay alive. If it becomes mechanical, reinstate it by making the prompt different each time.
- **Over-logging:** Log only at phase transitions (gate openings). Not every thought.
